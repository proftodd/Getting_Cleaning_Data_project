#H1 Running the analysis

The script to do the data set construction and analysis is run_analysis.R.

It assumes the data set located at https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip has been downloaded and extracted in the same location as the script.

The script will produce two text files representing space-delimited data: tidy_data.txt containing the assembled and formatted data, and summary.txt containing the summary of the results.
